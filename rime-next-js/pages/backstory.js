        Sandstone, an Earth Genasi, grew up on the very difficult streets of Luskan. His family had very little money and often he had to steal his dinner. Seeing no other way out, he became a Spearman in Luskanâ€™s pathetic army. He gave every penny he had to his family, as his parents were getting older and his brother and sister were both too young to make their own money. One day, he came home to find his entire family murdered in cold blood. He told the government of Luskan that something had to be done but no one cared enough to even begin looking into what had happened. That day he quit the army and told himself that he will find who killed his family, whatever it takes. Along the way, Sandstone ran into Bane. Bane promised Sandstone he would be able to get the vengeance he deserved. He taught Sandstone that the rest of the world is just as terrible as Luskan and that no one can be trusted. Sandstone learned that he had to be cunning to survive this world, and that the only way he would succeed in his quest is to be extremely cunning and personable. Sandstone is a lost soul that seeks nothing in life other than revenge from the thing that killed his family. However, no one who meets him would know that he is a tormented soul as they meet an upbeat, cheerful Genasi. Simply put, Sandstone is not who he seems to be.

        Sandstone followed leads of the one who killed his family. It brought him to the Dark Duchess, an infamous pirate ship with a large enough crew to hide among. On this voyage the sea was turbulent and got stuck in the ice. The captain stayed with the ship but the other fled towards Ten Towns. A blizzard overtook the crew and Sandstone was the lone survivor. Stuck in the frigid north.

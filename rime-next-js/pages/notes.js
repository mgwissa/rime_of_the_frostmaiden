              There is a cave close to Easthaven reportedly with Chardalyn
              directly to the East. Hit the mountains and you're there.
              <br />
              Cave was guarded by 2 white dragon whelplings and I had to pay 105
              gold to get in. The group owes me 21 per person.

              2 sacks were stolen from our rooms, there was a figure that was

              Me and Flint go through Captain Scath's room. We take 4 pendants
              of the Zentarim so everyone has one now.
              <br />
              We find letters between Scath and someone who signs their name "X"
              <br />
              Scath mentions East Haven, Cair Dineval, The Outhouse.
              <br />
              From the context of the letters it seems like X was not in the
              Zentarim but brought them in as outside help.
